# My Machine Learning Project

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects, mainly focused on **clustering, regression, and classification**.  

âœ¨ Key Points:
- Most algorithms are implemented **from scratch** using only fundamental Python libraries (NumPy, etc.)
- Includes visualization of results for better understanding
- Serves as an educational resource for learning ML basics
